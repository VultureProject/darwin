WIP FBUFFER REFACTOR THREAD MANAGMENT

Until now, BufferThreadManager.cpp/hpp were holding both 
BufferThreadManager and BufferThread classes. Now, 
BufferThreadManager inherits from AThreadManager and 
BufferThread inherits from AThread.

Files concerned:

_ AThreadManager.cpp/hpp: (toolkit folder)
New file created to hold AThreadManager class from which
BufferThreadManager inherits. It contains everything a
ThreadManager needs to handle several threads.

_ AThread.cpp/hpp: (toolkit folder)
New file created to hold AThread class from which BufferThread inherits.
It contains everything a Thread needs to run properly.

_ BufferThreadManager.cpp/hpp:
The former BufferThreadManager and BufferThread classes are now splitted
in two, the generic parts are in AThreadManager.cpp/hpp and 
AThread.cpp/hpp and the specific parts are in BufferThread.cpp/hpp and
BufferThreadManager.cpp/hpp.

_ BufferThread.cpp/hpp:
New file created to hold BufferThread class that inherits from AThread.
It contains everything needed to allow async buffering between filters
linked as outputs to fbuffer.

_ Generator.cpp/hpp, BufferTask.cpp/hpp:
Changed the includes and when needed the class names (functions, types)
to fit the new classes.

_ fbuffer.cmake:
Added new files for compilation.

My work is not tested, not documented, not finished yet.
